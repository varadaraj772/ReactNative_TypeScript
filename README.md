# ReactNative TypeScript Implementations

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project built using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli). It is implemented in **TypeScript** and includes commonly used components and navigation patterns with proper setups.

- **Navigations**:
  - **Stack Navigation**: For screen-to-screen transitions.
  - **Bottom Tab Navigation**: For organizing main app sections.
  - **Drawer Navigation**: For hidden side menus.
- **FlatList**: Optimized rendering for lists of data.
- **Modal**: Implementation of popups and overlays.
- Additional components and features will be added progressively.
